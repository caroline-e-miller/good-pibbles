    <h1>The Loveable, Cuddle-able Pit Bull</h1>

    <p>This is my pit bull Chewy, who is the goodest of all.</p>

    <p>Pit bulls are some of the silliest, derpiest, most loving dogs out there. Their cute little faces would even make
        a U.S. Senator smile. However, they get a bad rap because a few of them have done bad things. Labradors have
        seriously injured more people than pit bulls in the city of Denver in the last year alone. However, the mayor of
        Denver still
        issued a pit bull ban despite the city council voting against it.</p>

    <p>My pit bull, Chewy, was left at a shelter one day. He would stay there for three years, as hundreds of people
        passed over him to adopt other dogs. Some people said he'd never be adopted, but they were wrong! He has a
        loving home, and many followers on Instagram. This goes to show you how much you can learn from a pittie if you
        just give them a chance!</p>

    <p>Pit bulls are my favorite animal, because they are simply the goodest.</p>
